# Genetic Algorithm Optimizer

This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to optimize various benchmark functions.  
It demonstrates initialization, selection, crossover, mutation, and evolution to iteratively find better solutions.

## Features
- Supports multiple benchmark functions:
  - Booth Function
  - Beale Function
  - Three-Hump Camel Function
  - Sphere Function
  - Sum of Different Powers
- Evolution process with natural selection, crossover, and mutation
- Visualization of fitness across generations

## Files
- `main.py` â€“ Genetic Algorithm implementation with user menu
- Benchmark functions for testing optimization
- Evolution loop with plotted results

## Usage
Run:
```bash
python main.py
